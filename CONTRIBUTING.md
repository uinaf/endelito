# Contributing

## Requirements

- macOS
- Mise for cached local verification (optional)
- Go 1.26 or newer
- Node.js for bridge syntax and contract checks
- Xcode command line tools with `swift`, `xcrun`, `iconutil`, and `codesign`

## Build

```sh
make build
```

Install into Applications and PATH:

```sh
make install
```

See [README](README.md) for user-facing CLI commands and [Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the app, state file, URL scheme, and WebKit session model.

## Validate

Run these before pushing:

```sh
mise run verify
mise run --force verify # explicitly run the exhaustive gate
```

Without Mise, run the same exhaustive gate directly:

```sh
make verify
```

For UI changes, also launch the app and check the real state path:

```sh
make smoke-live
```

The live target runs the exhaustive gate first and reuses its app and CLI
artifacts for the launch proof.

For environment and runtime diagnostics:

```sh
make doctor
```

## Releases

Use Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, …); they drive versions.

Successful pushes to `main` evaluate commits after `verify` passes. The release
job mints a short-lived `uinaf-releaser` token inside the `release` Environment,
signs/notarizes, creates the GitHub Release, and updates the Homebrew cask. See
[Releases](docs/RELEASES.md) and [Distribution](docs/DISTRIBUTION.md).

## Pull Requests

- Create a focused branch from current `main` and open a pull request against `main`.
- Use the repo pull request template.
- Include meaningful verification in the PR description.
- Include the review aid that best explains a non-trivial change: a focused diagram, labeled screenshot, or sanitized input/output example.
- Keep vulnerability reports out of public issues; use [Security](SECURITY.md).

## Development Notes

- `ENDELITO_APP=/path/to/Endelito.app endelito launch` selects the app for every
  command, including when another copy is running. Missing overrides fail.
- `make test-playback` compiles the production intent owner and extracted
  AppDelegate command, timer, click-callback, and navigation methods. Deterministic
  fixtures cover cancellation, stale callbacks, duplicate attempts, cold playback,
  and retry limits without AppKit or a live WebView.
- Go transport tests build the actual CLI and replace `open`/`pgrep` with local
  fixtures; they do not launch an app. Live smoke sends commands through the CLI
  and starts with a cold non-default source command; stop the candidate app first.
  Its state checks do not establish audible playback or two-copy routing.
- The app stores CLI-readable state at `~/Library/Application Support/Endelito/state.json`.
- `bin/endelito debug` writes page inspection data next to the state file.
- Soundscape IDs and aliases live in `internal/sources/sources.json`; update that catalog instead of duplicating lists in Go or Swift.
- Build artifacts are ignored by git.

## Dependency automerge

- Eligible Renovate updates use GitHub auto-merge after required checks: verify and scan / Gitleaks, scan / TruffleHog, scan / Actionlint, scan / Zizmor.
- Checks are non-strict; repository admins and the existing release App retain direct writes through
  a bypass limited to the check ruleset. Renovate has no bypass.
- Shared release-age and major/digest rules remain unchanged. Add new voting
  checks to the ruleset; workflow presence alone does not require them.
