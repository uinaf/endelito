# Distribution

Endelito publishes versioned macOS app and CLI assets through
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/uinaf/endelito/releases) and the
[uinaf Homebrew tap](https://github.com/uinaf/homebrew-tap). It does not deploy
a running service.

Releases use Developer ID signed, Apple-notarized zip archives. Do not add Mac
App Store packaging without an explicit product decision.

## Signed Package

Release assets are built by:

```sh
CODESIGN_IDENTITY='Developer ID Application: …' make package-release
```

The target runs `make build`, signs the app and CLI with hardened runtime and a
secure timestamp, verifies both signatures, copies `build/Endelito.app`,
`bin/endelito`, `VERSION`, and README/license material into `dist/Endelito/`,
then creates `dist/endelito-<version>-macos-<arch>.zip`. Release publishing uses
`make notarize-release`, which submits that archive to Apple's notary service,
staples and validates the app ticket, and rebuilds the final archive.

The CLI binary embeds the release version from `VERSION`, so
`bin/endelito --version` matches the semantic-release version when the archive
is prepared. `make build-app` also stamps `CFBundleShortVersionString` /
`CFBundleVersion` in `Info.plist` and replaces `__ENDELITO_VERSION__` in the
bundled WebKit bridge.

## Homebrew Cask

Released versions are installable through the tap; see
[README](../README.md#install) for the user-facing command.

The cask lives at `Casks/endelito.rb` in
[uinaf/homebrew-tap](https://github.com/uinaf/homebrew-tap) and points at the
GitHub Release zip through a `#{version}` URL template. It installs both
`Endelito.app` and the `endelito` CLI. The release workflow bumps that cask
only after GitHub verifies the published immutable release.

## Continuous Release

[`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) contains both jobs:

- `verify` runs `make smoke-live` on pushes and pull requests, except
  `[skip ci]` release commits. That target completes the exhaustive repository
  gate, then reuses its exact CLI and app artifacts for the live
  CLI → URL scheme → app state proof on the macOS runner.
- `release` runs after `verify` on normal pushes to `main`.

Both jobs run on standard GitHub-hosted `macos-26` runners (ARM64). The
separate `update-homebrew-tap` job uses `ubuntu-24.04` (x64).

Semantic-release reads Conventional Commits on `main`. When a release is
warranted, it:

1. Computes the next version using the `conventionalcommits` preset.
2. Writes the version to `VERSION` and commits it to `main` through GitHub's
   signed App commit API.
3. Signs the app and CLI from that commit, notarizes the archive, staples the
   app ticket, and builds the final `dist/*.zip`.
4. Creates the version tag and a draft GitHub Release, then uploads the zip
   asset from `dist/`.
5. Validates the draft manifest, publishes the release once, and verifies its
   immutable-release attestation.
6. Bumps the cask version and checksum in `uinaf/homebrew-tap` through
   Homebrew's `brew bump-cask-pr`, including Homebrew's cask audit and style
   checks before pushing the tap commit.

The `[skip ci]` release commit is intentional: both CI jobs skip it so
publishing does not recursively trigger another verify and release run.

The release job allows up to 90 minutes for Apple's notarization queue before
failing. Signing completes before submission; a notarization timeout is not an
Apple rejection and remains visible in App Store Connect submission history.

## GitHub Policy

Keep GitHub configured for direct maintainer pushes plus automated release
writeback:

- Default branch: `main`.
- Merge policy: squash merge only; delete branches after merge.
- Ruleset `protect-main` on the default branch: block deletion and
  non-fast-forward updates; require signed commits without a release App bypass.
- Ruleset `protect-release-tags` on `refs/tags/v*`: block tag deletion and
  updates; require signed tags. `uinaf-releaser` may bypass.
- Required verification and scan checks use a separate non-strict ruleset.
  Admins and `uinaf-releaser` bypass only this check rule, preserving signed
  release-version writeback. Renovate has no bypass.
- Actions policy: selected actions only; allow GitHub-owned actions, verified
  actions, `actions/create-github-app-token@*`,
  `cycjimmy/semantic-release-action@*`,
  `Homebrew/actions/setup-homebrew@*`, and reusable workflows from
  `uinaf/.github/*`.
- Environment: the release job uses the approval-free `release` environment,
  restricted to workflow runs from `main`.
- GitHub writes: short-lived `uinaf-releaser` installation token
  (`UINAF_RELEASE_APP_CLIENT_ID` + `UINAF_RELEASE_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`) scoped to
  `endelito` + `homebrew-tap`.
- Signing secrets: `APPLE_DEVELOPER_ID_CERTIFICATE_P12_BASE64`,
  `APPLE_DEVELOPER_ID_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`, and `APPLE_NOTARY_API_KEY_P8`.
- Notarization variables: `APPLE_NOTARY_API_KEY_ID` and
  `APPLE_NOTARY_API_ISSUER_ID`.

See [Releases](RELEASES.md) for the publish contract. Keep its signed writeback
path working when changing repository rules.

## Workflow Maintenance

- Keep workflow actions pinned to full commit SHAs with same-line version
  comments. One exception: the shared scan caller tracks
  `uinaf/.github/.github/workflows/scan.yml@main` by design, so digest bumps
  land once for every adopter; `.github/zizmor.yml` encodes that split.
- Keep semantic-release and plugins pinned in the workflow `extra_plugins`
  block rather than adding release-only Node dependencies to the repo.
- Keep `@semantic-release/github` at `12.0.9` or newer so Node 24 runners can
  upload release assets.
- Keep the release job non-cancellable so a tag/release publish is not
  interrupted midway.
- Keep immutable releases enabled. Upload and validation must finish against a
  mutable draft; the Homebrew update starts only after publication succeeds.
- Renovate updates GitHub Actions and mise tools through `renovate.json`,
  which extends the shared `uinaf/renovate-config` preset. Go has no
  third-party modules to track.
